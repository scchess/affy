##took out the names functions
*names.Cdf
*names.Cel.R
*names.Plob.R
*names.PPSet.R
	
##added the following S4 methods for Plob
pm
mm
nchips
nprobes
chip.names
probe.names
cdf
ngenes
x
y
numbers	
ncol
nrow
plot
hist
pData
varLabels
phenoData
	
##removed the function plot.Plob
*cvs remove plot.Plob.R
##removed the function hist.Plob
*cvs remove hist.Plob.R
##removed the function boxplot.Plob
*cvs remove boxplot.Plob.R

##changed Plob class to have the following slots to make more similar to
##exprSet and also to avoid slots that are not needed 

pm
mm
name
numbers
cdf.names
x
y
nrow
ncol
phenoData
annotation
description
notes

added the following methods to cel
intensity
sd
chipName
masks
outliers
history
image

*remove the file image.Cel

added the following methods for cdf
name.levels
pbase
pbase.levels
tbase
tbase.levels
atom
probeNames

added the following methods for PPSet
probes
probeName
pm
mm
barplot
plot

*removed files plot.PPSet and barplot.PPSet

changed normalize generic 
added normalize.Plob.quantiles
added normalize.Plob.contrasts
added normalize.Cel.contrasts
*added file normalize.contrasts
##laurent: can you add a normalize.Cel.contrast
	
for PPSet.container i added:
probeNames
###ask laurent: whats wrong with CDF.example
###why not have a slot in cel.container denoting the default Cdf
###then change all functions so that one does not need to pass Cdf
###with this and some methods we maybe able to get rid of Plobs entirely 
###maybe this is a version 2.0 task.

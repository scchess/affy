###Rafa's changes

"changelog" added this file
	
*"test" 
	+removed empty file test

*"proj.vec" 
	+changed proj.vec to projvec in R and Rd

*"class-Plob.Rd" 
	+created this file with help file for Plob

*"class-probe.matrix.Rd" 
	+created this file but ended up removing it

*"probe.level.object.Rd" 
	+changed file 

*"old2newPlob" created function  
	+makes old probe level objects into Class Plob. there is R and Rd

*"zzz.R" 
	+edited so that it runs .initPlob 

*"ReadAffy" 
	+changed in R and Rd. 
	+Now one can specify if one wants to make outlier and/or masks into outliers. It passes along arguments to read.celfile. 
	+It now returns an object of class Plob.

*"probe.level.object" 
	+changed help file on  to say its old.

*"bxp2.R" and "boxplot.default2.R"
	+added these files and then removed them so ignore this

###Leslie's changes
*"Plob.R"
   +changed class of pm and mm to data.frame and removed 
     def of class "probe.matrix"
   +eliminated "id" slot and "gene.names" slot and added "name" slot
   +changed method for $ to allow auto-completion of slot name
   +removed methods for Math which I could never make work properly

*"ReadAffy.R"
   +made pm and mm slots into data.frames
   +pm and mm have no rownames, but data.frame names are chip.names
   +eliminated id and gene.names slot and made name slot
   +if no cdf.name is provided it is derived from name of cdf file

*"convert.R"
   +made pm and mm slots into data.frames
   +pm and mm have no rownames, but data.frame names are chip.names
   +eliminated id and gene.names slot and made name slot
   +if no cdf.name is provided, it is derived from name of cdf object
   
*"boxplot.Plob"
   +removed arguments so only the object x and ,... remain
   +fixed the prompting using the "ask" option in par
   +eliminated dependence on boxplot.probe.matrix
   +still uses boxplot.default2 which can be changed
	
*"boxplot.probe.matrix"
   +no longer used.  Should be removed

*"mva.pairs.Plob"
   + made a method. there is no file. its defined in Plob.R	
   +removed arguments so only the object x and ,... remain
     it just samples 5000 total values from mm and pm for each chip 
     and calls mva.pairs to give a quick convenient look

*"hist.Plob"
   +removed arguments so only object x,col.pm, and col.mm and ,... remain
   +fixed both x and y range problems
   +fixed prompt using par option "ask" and made it "smart" 
     with respect to mfrow options
   +added the hidden and undocumented function .hist.Plob to do the work

*"plot.Plob"
   +removed arguments so only the object x and ,... remain
   +fixed prompt using par option "ask" and made it "smart" 
     with respect to mfrow options
   +uses mva.pairs.Plob,.hist.Plob, and boxplot.default2
   +plots mva first, and sets mfcol to (1,1) since these are large
    then it resets mfcol for remaining plots

###BACK to Rafa's changes
*"ReadAffy"
	+changed names(pm) <- .. to colnames etc...
*"covert"
	+changed names(pm) <- .. to colnames etc...
	+added line   probe.names <- info@name.levels[probe.ids]

*"boxplot.Plob"
      +using R base boxplot
      +removed boxplot.default2 and bxp2

"boxplot.Plob.Rd"
	+ need to write help file
   
*"hist.Plob.R"
	+ added some missing ... in file .hist.Plob

"hist.Plob" 
	+added Rd file

	+ removed this file
      
*"affy.mva.pairs.R" 
	+ removed this file

*"mva.pairs.Plob.R"
	+ removed this file, used setMethod instead

"affy.mva.paris.Rd"
	+ changed this to mva.paris.Plob


"plot.Plob.R"
	+changed mva.pairs.Plob to mva.pairs since the method now exists
	+change boxplot.default2 to boxplot
	+there are some minor problems with this function. NEEDS FIX


*"mva.pairs"
	+changed lines(xx[o],aux[o]) to lines(approx(xx[o],aux[o])


*"read.container.celfile"
	+ changed so that it can use vectors along with ...
	 filenames <- as.list(substitute(list(...)))[-1]
	  list <- .Primitive("c")(list, filenames)
 

*"image.Cel"
	+ took out col as an option so that it uses the image.default col

*"Cdf.R"
	+ changed a print to a cat

*"affy.subset.R" 
	+ added and made a method for "["

*"names.Cel.R"
	+ADDED this file

*"names.CDF.R"
	+ADDED this file

*"names.PPSet.R"
	+ADDED this file


*"Cel.R"
	+setMethod $

*"Cdf.R"
	+setMethod $

*"PPSet.R"
	+setMethod $
	+fixed method show so that it shows number of probe pairs

*"Normalize.R"
	+added this. it used to be normalize.Raffy

*"normalize.R"
	+deleted this. now its Normalize.R

*"normalize.Raffy.Rd"
	+changed to Normalize.Rd


###Laurent's moves (reported here for the first since I just discovered the existence of this file)
*"affy.tour.R"
	+created in demo/. This a demo for the package.

*"Cel.R"
	+commented out setMethod $	

*"Cdf.R"
	+commented out setMethod $	

*"PPSet.R"
	+commented out setMethod $	

*"image.Cel.R"
	+put a grey scale as a default for the parameter col of image (to be evaluated... just found the the 'heat' scale too flashy... I will surrender to the opnion of the majority)	

*"Cel.R"
	+fixed the method 'normalize' for Cel.container

*"Plob.R"
	+fixed the method 'normalize'

*"zzz.R"
	+added a debug flag ('debug.affy123')

*"generateExprSet.Cel.container.R"
	+fixed it (it was not working at all). Added a parameter 'ids'.

*"generateExprSet.Cel.container.man"
	+added an example

*"generateExprVal.PPSet.container.R"
	+fixed it (was not quite working the way it should)

*"Cel.R"
	+fixed the method names.PPSet.container

*"names.PPSet.R"
	+commented out 

*"names.Cel.R"
	+commented out 

*"names.Cdf.R"
	+commented out 

*"affy.Rnw"
	+created in /inst/doc/. Far from being complete...

###TO FIX  

"barplot.PPSet" 
	+gives a warning when called with a PPSet object with col.mm or col.pm


"Normalize" make normalize work with Plobs. 
	
".hist.Plob.R"
	+should it stay ? Rafa? Leslie? 

*"generateExprSet.Cel.container.R"
	+slow, slow, slooooooooowwwwwwwww....

*"normalize.loess.R"
	+running into problems with some data

###to ADD

"Rd files": Normalize, plot.Plob, hist.Plob, probably more
"mva.pairs.CEL.container"

"cbind" for Plobs

"Dilution" Plob

"Spike in" PPSet container

"Demo"
